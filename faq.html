            <p>Lock bumping, in most cases, does not cause damage to the lock, except if a bump key snaps in the
                keyhole. The majority of lock bumping attempts go undiscovered because the locks continue to work. This
                article explains lock bumping, which signs indicate lock bumping attempts, and what you can do to
                safeguard your door locks..</p>

            <h5> Can I Rekey My Own Locks?</h5>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, you can rekey your own locks, and nothing is stopping you from doing it, except for the fact that
                all locks are different. Many people think that rekeying a lock is a simple matter of replacing the
                cylinder inside their locks. What they later find out is that getting to the cylinder and replacing it
                reliably isn’t all that simple.

                Even seasoned locksmiths have practiced rekeying for years to ensure that they are proficient. That’s
                why even though you can rekey locks, you shouldn’t bet your home or businesses’ security on it.</p>
